# Solrise ERP

A portable, code-configured Solrise ERP deployment: **CRM**, **Service Desk**,
**HRMS**, approvals, notifications, reporting and administration - built from
`frappe_docker`, run on rootless Podman locally and on any Ubuntu VPS in
production.

Nothing in this repo is tied to a single host, provider or container engine.
One `.env` drives both environments.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    U[Users] -->|443| T[Traefik + Let's Encrypt]
    T --> F[Frontend nginx]
    F --> B[Backend gunicorn]
    F --> W[Websocket socketio]
    B --> DB[(MariaDB)]
    B --> RC[(Redis cache)]
    QS[Queue short] --> RQ[(Redis queue)]
    QL[Queue long] --> RQ
    S[Scheduler] --> RQ
    B --> RQ
    RQ --> DB

    RC --> B
```

Locally the `Traefik` hop is replaced by `frontend` publishing port `8080`.

## Quick start (local)

```bash
cp .env.example .env         # edit the passwords
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
make image                   # build erpnext + hrms image (first run: ~15 min)
make local-up                # start the stack
make site                    # create the site + install apps
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** and log in as `Administrator` with the
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`.

Then apply the programmatic configuration:

```bash
./scripts/run-python.sh scripts/setup_erp.py     # modules, SLA, leave types
./scripts/run-python.sh scripts/roles_rbac.py    # roles + permissions
```

## Quick start (production VPS)

```bash
# On the VPS, as root, from a clone of this repo:
sudo SWAP_SIZE=4G ./scripts/bootstrap-vps.sh

# As the deploy user:
cp .env.example .env         # set DOMAIN, SITE_NAME, ports 80/443, DOCKER_SOCK
make image
SITE_ENV=prod make prod-up
SITE_ENV=prod make site
```

## Common commands

```bash
make help          # list every target
make image         # build the custom image
make local-up      # start local stack
make site          # create site + install apps (idempotent)
make logs          # tail logs
make shell         # bash inside the backend container
make backup        # dump DB + files to ./backups
make fixtures      # export fixtures

SITE_ENV=prod make prod-up   # production stack
SITE_ENV=prod make prod-logs
SITE_ENV=prod make backup
```

## Configuration model

1. **Image** - `apps.json` + `APPS_JSON` bake `erpnext` and `hrms` into
   `solrise/erpnext:<tag>`. Apps are never `get-app`'d inside a running
   container, because that is lost on recreate.
2. **Runtime** - `compose/compose.local.yaml` (no TLS) and
   `compose/compose.prod.yaml` (Traefik + Let's Encrypt) share the same service
   topology; only exposure and developer-mode differ.
3. **Data** - everything that must survive lives in a named volume declared in
   `.env`: `solrise_sites`, `solrise_db_data`, `solrise_redis_queue`,
   `solrise_letsencrypt`.
4. **Application config** - `scripts/setup_erp.py` and `scripts/roles_rbac.py`
   are idempotent and version-safe. The custom app applies workflows,
   notifications, reports and dashboards itself on every `bench migrate`
   (`solrise_erp.install.apply_all`). Everything is exported as fixtures under
   `fixtures/` so a fresh deployment reproduces itself.

## Portability guarantees

- Same `.env` keys on every host; only values change.
- Same service names and image across Podman and Docker.
- `CONTAINER_ENGINE` / `COMPOSE_CMD` switch the tooling without editing YAML.
- Backup and restore work across site names and across engines
  (`bench backup --with-files` -> `bench restore`).
- No host paths are hard-coded outside bind mounts that are opt-in.
